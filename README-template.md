## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have used the flex property that I learned in my last project. I got to know about using background property and image on same element.
I learn about giving my img `display: block;` CSS because it is an inline element and it helps me understand where that space under the image comes from.

### Continued development

I will try to work more with max and min property.
